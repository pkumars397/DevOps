#CI/CD 
>>CI > take code and packaging it up (gifts >> wrapping)

>>running unit test ,integration test etc. missing any packages or any issues

code >> packing it up >> deploy the code on some system (vms)

CD>> once the code is packaged >> deploy

#differences 
continous delivery not same as continous deployment (code >> CI done >> deploy)

continous delivery >> we have to press some button on system when deploying ..human intervention
