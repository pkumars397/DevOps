Why Docker?
>>due to issues with os and environment for different devs.

>>With Docker we can run our app with libs and dependency in different container.
>>Docker containers share underlying os kernal ,for linux kernal .all linux distributions can run.

>>Hardware Infra. > OS > Docker > Container> App(libs and dep.),fast bootup
>>VM >> Hypervisor >>VM >APP ,slow bootup 

#Container vs Image
>>Docker image >> package template plan (use to create one or more container)

>>Developer and ops both work together ,and create docker image,this image can run on any host with docker on it. 

#install Docker engine 
>> using convinient script 
>>go to docker hub and test some image ,check if its working perfectly or not.
