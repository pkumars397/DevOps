>>docker hub place for images 

>>docker run centos(direct name ,when personal have to include the username also,pkumars/demoImg)

>docker ps

>>docker stop nameCon. Or Id ((stop the container))

>>docker ps -a 

(everything lies on disk space) 

#free up disk space from stopped container 

>>docker rm ConName or ConId 

>>docker rm id1 id2  ... > multiple container(based with image) in one stop 


#pulled images 
>>docker images (pulled images)

>>docker rmi imageName > will remove imageName 

>you can't remove the image which is currently ,in some container on disk.so have to remove that container ,then delete image

e.g . docker run centos 
      docker rmi centos (will give error that image is being used)
      docker rm ConId 
      docker rmi centos(now it will remove because we removed the container from disk)

#pull (just pull no run)
>>docker pull ubuntu .. will pull the image and store it locally without running 

#running command on particular container 

>>docker run -d ubuntu sleep 100

(its running in background)
for running a command inside this container 

>>docker ps 
>>docker exec ConId cat /etc/*release* ,docker exec id then followed by command which u want to run on container.
