>when installing docker engine 
1.Docker CLI > command line interface of Docker
2.RestAPI >interface to talk to deamon and provide instructions
3.Docker deamon >bg process that manages docker object like images,con. ,volumes ,storage ,networks.

>docker cli can work on other host also,with -H=remote-docker-engine:2375 

# Containerzation 
>docker uses namespaces for isolation,i.e ,process id,network,unix timesharing,mount

# PID namespace (process id)

Linux Start > PID1 
>unique ,cann't be same 

pid1 >> pid2 ,child container

>all processes running on same host but separated into their own containers using namespace .

## cgroups (cpu groups)

>container can take all hardware resources available on host ,no limit for it.
>but we can control that , 
>docker run --cpus=0.5 ubuntu ,can only utilise 50 percentage of cpu.
>docker run --memory=100m ubuntu, can take max of 100m of storage.
