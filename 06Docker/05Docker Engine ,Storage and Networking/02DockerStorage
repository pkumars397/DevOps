## Docker files system 
> Docker how stores data and how it manages file systems of containers.

>when u install docker engine ,it creates a folder ,/var/lib/docker 

\\ images ,containers stored into it.

\\ Layered Architecture ,each layer changes its cache it,if at some layer failour ,then again build will be continued from there.

>> lets say have to make changes in source code only and remaining level same ,so it will continue building the image from layer4.

        Layer1 Base layer
        Layer2 change in apt packages
        Layer3 change in pip packages
        Layer4 source code 
        Layer5 update enterypoint with flask command 
when build this image,and run it creates a new layert6 container layer 

>>we use same dockerfile for multiple containers with some changes ,but container creates a new source code copy in that container.

# volumes
>benifits,stores backup data on local host,if anything wrong happen to our container ,data is safe with us.
> docker volume create data_volume 
>docker run -v data_volume=/var/lib/docker/mysql mysql

>docker run -v data_volume2=/var/lib/docker/mysql mysql (will create data_volume2 automatically)

>docker run \ --mount type=bind, source=/data/mysql ,target=/var/lib/docker/mysql mysql 
(same longer version)
