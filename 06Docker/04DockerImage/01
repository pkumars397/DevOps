#how to create an image

>os ubuntu
>update apt repo
>install dep. using apt
>install py dep using pip
>copy source code to /opt folder 
>run the web servering using flask command


create a Dockerfile..

code ...

Dockerfile
FROM Ubuntu 

RUN apt-get update 
RUN apt-get install python 

RUN pip install flask 
RUN pip install flask-mysql 

copy ./opt/source-code

ENTERYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source_code/app.py flask run 

>>build ur image 

>docker build Dockerfile -t mmumshad/my-custom-app (will create image locally)

if you want to docker hub ..
>docker push userid/my-custom-app 


!Dockerfile > a text file written in specific format that docke can understand ,its an instrutiona and arguments format

instructions>> RUN FROM COPY ,left side caps 

arguments>> everything in right is arguments .. specific action while creating image.

e.g ,
FROM Ubuntu , what base os should be.every docker image must be based off of another image,either an OS or another image that was created.
 
>all dockerfile starts with FROM instruction.

>RUN command ,this instruction instruct docker to run a command on those base images. 

>COPY path , to copy ur source code from local to docker image.

>ENTERPOINT ,instruction that do allow us to specify a command that will be run when the image is run as a container.

## Layer architecture 

>base os 
>changes in apt pack..
>changes in pip pack..
>source code 
>updte enterpoint with flask command 

>> docker history, to see the build of images info. 

>all layer built are cached ,so that layered arch helps you restart Docker build from that particular layer or add new step .

> if fails then re run ,docker build .will use cached layer.

#### what can you containerize .

>>can containerized ,browser ,curl ,spotify everything.
